# A RESTful API


#### This uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) for the back-end with a SQL DB to store the items and [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) for the front-end.


### How To

* To view the api items got to `your_site/api/items`.
* To access a individual item `your_site/api/items/%id`.

Don't forget to do **`composer update`** on the project back-end folder and edit your **`.env`** and **`host`** files with your settings to work.
